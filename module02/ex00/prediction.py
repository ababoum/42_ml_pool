	"""Computes the prediction vector y_hat from two non-empty numpy.array.
	Args:
	x: has to be an numpy.array, a matrix of dimension m * n.
	theta: has to be an numpy.array, a vector of dimension (n + 1) * 1.
	Return:
	y_hat as a numpy.array, a vector of dimension m * 1.
	None if x or theta are empty numpy.array.
	None if x or theta dimensions are not matching.
	None if x or theta is not of expected type.
	Raises:
	This function should not raise any Exception.
